# Backstory

Probes have been sent to catalogue the life to be found on exoplanets.

The probes drop drones onto the planet to survey the animals, birds and plant life.

Each drone hosts an onboard machine-learning model that is trained to find,
identify and catalogue alien life.

There are three key models:

- animals
- birds
- plants

There is a fourth model that was been trained on the more extreme examples of
life found on Earth. In an attempt to fill in the gaps between the major orders,
its trained to identify bioforms that don't fall into the other categories.

The drones take photos, videos and other readings which are collected by the probe.

The drones have also been trained as naturalists. To give them curiosity.

Bandwidth is low and transmissions are slow.

The probes are sending data packages back from their survey. Like messages in
a bottle. Or a bot.

But brief excerpts are being sent back during the survey. To provide brief reports
of data. Describing what has been found.

As part of a social media campaign the probes have been given names and social
media accounts. As all good space robots do these days.

These messages are what we are receiving.

# Ecoregions

To provide some generic context for where data has been collected, the probes
refer to a simple ecoregion classification based on Bailey (1989)

- polar domain
- temperate domain
- dry domain
- tropical domain
- marine domain

Types of life form and adjectives are related to the ecoregions
